# Story

You are a messy and locked yourself in your room. You sneezed and the key fell
behind a mountain of trash. Now you have to get it, because lectures start in 5
minutes.

Each obstacle has a back story and powers: ex. you find your phone. M8 texts
"Lecture starts 10 minutes later today" you get an extra 10 minutes.
